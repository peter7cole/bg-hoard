### üíª Lab 2 - Generate a React app

###### ‚è∞ &nbsp;Estimated time: 15-20 minutes

> Before starting this lab, you can either clone this Git repository you're looking at (`master` branch will be the starting point) or continue in the folder you created. If you clone, you will get access to all the lab branches so you can `git checkout lab-xx` if you fall behind.

In this lab we'll generate our first React application within the new monorepo.

## üìö Learning outcomes:

- **Get familiar with generating new apps within your workspace using the Nx CLI**

#### üì≤ After this workshop, your app should look similar to this:

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps:

1. Make sure you can run Nx commands:
   - try out `nx --version` and see if it outputs a version number
   - install the CLI globally: `npm i -g @nrwl/cli`
   - if you don't want to install it globally, use `yarn nx` (if you have yarn) or `npx nx` (otherwise) instead of `nx` in all the commands in the upcoming labs

   > Please make sure you are using the latest version of Nx (12.6+)
<br />

2. Run `nx list` to see which plugins you have installed
<br />

3. Add the React plugin: `yarn add @nrwl/react` or `npm i -S @nrwl/react`
<br />

4. Let's also add Material UI so we can use some of their components: `yarn add @material-ui/core` or `npm i -S @material-ui/core`
<br />

5. Use the [`@nrwl/react` plugin](https://nx.dev/react/api/react/generators/application) to generate an React app called `store` in your new workspace

   ‚ö†Ô∏è**Important:** Make sure you **add React Router** and select **SCSS** as a style when asked!

6. Create a `fake-api.ts` file in your new app that returns an array of some games (you can just copy the code from [here](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/fake-api/index.ts))

   ‚è≥**Reminder:** When you are given example files to copy, the folder they're in hints to the _folder_ and _filename_ you can place them in when you do the copying
<br />

7. Add some basic styling to your new component and display the games from the Fake API (to not spend too much time on this, you can copy it from here [.tsx](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/app/app.tsx) / [.scss](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/app/app.module.scss) - and replace the full contents of the files)
<br />

8. You can get the example game images from [here](../../examples/lab2/apps/store/src/assets)

   ‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you put them in the correct folder
<br />

9. Serve the app: `nx serve store`
<br />

10. See your app live at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
<br />

11. Inspect what changed from the last time you committed, then commit your changes
<br />

Your app should look similar to the screenshot above!

Now we're starting to see some content! But the ratings also don't look that good - we'll fix those in **Lab 5**.
